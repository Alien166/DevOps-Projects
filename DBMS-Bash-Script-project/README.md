# DBMS Bash Script Project üóÑÔ∏è

This project is a lightweight, command-line-based **Database Management System (DBMS)** implemented entirely using **Bash scripting**. It provides fundamental database operations without requiring any external databases or additional software, making it an ideal tool for learning Bash scripting and performing small-scale data management tasks.

## Features:
- **Create Databases**: Create new databases and manage them through the command line.
- **List Databases**: Display a list of available databases.
- **Connect to Databases**: Access and interact with databases using a simple command-line interface.
- **Drop Databases**: Delete existing databases from the system.
- **Create Tables**: Define tables within connected databases with custom structures.
- **Insert into Tables**: Add new records into the tables.
- **Select From Tables**: Query and retrieve records from tables.
- **Update Tables**: Modify existing records in tables.
- **Delete From Tables**: Remove specific records from tables.
- **Drop Tables**: Delete tables from databases.

## Project Structure:
- **Main Menu**:
  - Create, list, connect to, or drop databases.
- **Database Menu** (After connecting to a database):
  - Create, list, insert into, select from, update, delete, or drop tables.

## Technologies Used:
- **Bash Scripting**: The entire project is implemented using Bash, demonstrating file handling, text manipulation, and scripting logic.

## Usage:
This DBMS system can be run directly from the command line on any Unix-based operating system with Bash. It's lightweight and doesn't require any additional dependencies, making it perfect for quick data manipulation and learning purposes.
